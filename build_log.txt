      You should consider explicitly keeping the mentioned classes
      (using '-keep').
      (https://platform.guardsquare.com/manual/dexguard/stable/9.4.21/troubleshooting.html#descriptorclass)
Note: there were 2 unresolved dynamic references to classes or interfaces.
      You should check if you need to specify additional program jars.

Note: there were 1 initializations of Javascript interface classes for WebView.
      You should consider explicitly keeping the interface methods
      (using something like '-keepclassmembers ..... { public <methods>; }').
